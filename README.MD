# 42sh
This is the final project of the Unix branch at [Le 101](https://www.le-101.fr/), the culmination of the first year of study: a working shell, full of cool features!

This project was coded in C, following the Norm used by the school (see [References](#references) below). The program is not allowed to crash, nor leak any memory.

It was designed for MacOS but should work fine on Linux: simply `make` and enjoy!

Made with love and care by [Thibault Le Cozanet](https://github.com/lazareus-dev), [Vitor Branco](https://github.com/vbranco) & [Vincent Schlumberger](https://github.com/vischlum)

## Mandatory part
* Execution of commands with arguments and path management
* Line acquisition (prompt display, reading of a command line, proper space and tabulations management)
* Builtins with their POSIX options: `cd`, `echo`, `exit`, `env`, `setenv`, `unsetenv`
* Error and commands' return value management
* Redirections: ">", ">>", "<", "|"
* Logical operators: "&&", "||"
* Separator: ";"

## Bonuses
* Dynamic autocompletion with <kbd>Tab</kbd>
* Hash table for binaries, `hash` command
* Command history, `history` and `!` builtins
* Local variables, `unset` and `export` builtins
* Inhibitors: double quote ("), simple quote ('), backslash (\\)
* Advanced redirections: file output aggregation and heredoc (<<)
* Line edition
    * Cursor movement
        * <kbd>Right/Left</kbd> Move letter by letter
        * <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Right/Left</kbd> Move word by word
        * <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Up/Down</kbd> Move up/down from one line to another in the command while remaining in the same column
        * <kbd>Home/End</kbd> Get to the beginning/end of the command
    * Cut/copy/paste
        * <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> Cut the whole command
        * <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>S/D</kbd> Cut everything before/after the cursor
        * <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> Copy the whole command
        * <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>X/C</kbd> Copy everything before/after the cursor
        * <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> Paste
